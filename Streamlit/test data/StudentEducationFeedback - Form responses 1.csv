27/07/2023 1:00,Louis Gan,louisgan91@gmail.com,Bachelor of Degree,Mechatronics Engineering,Lecturers are knowledgeable on the subjects that they taught. However the way of presentation may not be so interesting as there are a lot of calculations in engineering.

This may not demonstrate a very good understanding from the lecturers themselves.,Examination questions are usually taught in class before. So it is okay and easy to score if you have been paying attention in class ,Some of the equipment are not provided and there is not much tools for us to work with,The library is located in south wing which is opposite of our north wing campus.
