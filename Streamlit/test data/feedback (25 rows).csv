punctuality and lecture is good here but interaction isn't good.,Its nice .,everything is good.,practicals are pretty well.,I don't know abt that bcoz i didn't go to library till now.,not every one is getting opportunities here only recommended students getting.
good enough,not good ,"excellent but checking procedure is not exceptable since we  fail to know our faults in mid term..
",good,facilities are good to overcome one's need,it seems to me very good since it is a good source of interaction with other and to built a leadership quilities and to overcome our faults.

Very good indeed. ,The depth of course is very much  deep. According to me its very essential,I don't like the -ve marking system. appart from that everything is great,Very good,Required text books are not available to every student,One of the best things I like about this university. The best of all.
"Teaching is excellent,but lecture delivery is not up to the mark.Punctuality is good",Some subjects are good and predictable.Remaining courses are not satisfactory,"Returning the question paper after the exams to be expected,because to clear and clarify the doubts regarding particular subjects",Its Good,Its good,They are extraordinary
interaction of some faculty was good but not all faculty..,depth  of course was good ....providing a basic knowledge not so deep in subjects....at least they should provide deep knowledge and syllabus in core subjects...,examination pattern was excellent,lab and practical works are good..with a little draw back of faculty in connecting  the lab practical to the outside  world..,library facilities are excellent...but only limited books are available ..so books should be increased.,extra curricular are so good. university is providing many pathways to many students....apart from education
"good, and also like the teaching style",I like this very much because every subject is linked up with real life situations and every thing in the subject is use full,good,I like it soo much,good ,good
"Interaction between students and teachers is good ,The lectures delivery is fine, punctuality is good
 

","depth of the course are depended on the level of student intake, course material is delivered after the class in UMS 

","Exams are conducted upon the the basis of the revised chapters upto that point, marks distribution is appropriate, paper checking is good

not bad,good,very hard papers and main concept papers,very strcitly they evaluted marks ,very good there we can find several course books and we can find several reference books also...,in this university there is lot of events and lot of extra curriclar activities....

I WAS A STUDENT OF A BOARDING SCHOOL .....(jnv) I STUDIED FOR 7  YEARS THERE RESIDING IN HOSTEL ..NOW LIVING IN LPU IS SAME LIKE THAT..AND STILL MORE SAME AND PUNCTUALITY IS SHOWN HERE BY BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS...AND ALSO BY THE STAFF..          SECURITY IS ABOVE 90%(IN CASE OF  STUDENT IS WELL MANURED)  ....CLASSES REGULAR ....SPORTS DAILY.....PARTICIPATION WELL/.......QUALITY BELOW AVERAGE,LESS TIME FOR STUDY ...LESS TIME FOR PAPER ATTEMTING...LESS TIME FOR EVERY THING ....LESS KNOWLEGE.....LESS DEPTH OF COURSE .....BUT PROPER COURSE MATERIAL ACCORDING TO EXAM,NICE TIMING..,NOT GOOD ...,VERY NICE....BUT BOOKS ARE NOT AVAILABE EVERY TIME,VERY HIGH......NEED TO TAKE DOWN SOME ACCITIVTIES ................................NOISE POLLITION IN THE UNIVERSITY  ALWAYS A BIG PROBLEM.
All terms are good regarding the university activities,knowledge is maximum gained by reading books also the teachers explain depth if we are interested to know about it.,That's good to have a negative marking pattern in exam but the time is not sufficient to do all the questions.,Labs helps to know how the work is done.It thought me a good lessons.,They are good.,Yes.
GOOD,HAVE TO IMPROVE,EXAMPATTERN IS GOOD AND MARKS DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO GOOD AND PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD ,IT IS GOOD,IT IS ALSO GOOD,VERY GOOD
intraction is good and leacture delivery also good and then punctuality is also is good,every one can tell depth of course but some one only give notes,exam pattern is good and marks distribution is also good but paper checking is too hard,all labs and practical going on well,good ,they all are held in super
all the given terms are good regarding the university ,we are getting maximum knowledge ,all are good ,not bad,library facilities are not good.They are not following the rules( they are using phones in library).,good
All the terms are good regarding the university activities.,Knowledge is maximum gained  by reading books and also teachers explain the concept in depth.,The examination pattern is good .But time is not sufficient for those questions.,Labs are upto the mark.,They are good,the extracurricular activities held in university  are very enjoyable and good
Some of the teacher are un experienced. Also they are unfair and baised. Infact many of the teachers are having few or no experience about the subject ,Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us.,MCQ pattern is quite good and efficient way for evolving students.,Our labs do not have all facalities. ,We have a good library with all facalities.,Our university has lot of extracurricular going on and it helps us a lot.
IT IS GOING GOOD,HAVE TO IMPROVE,PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD REMAINING IS GOOD,ALL PRACTICAL WORK IS GOOD,"THEY IS NO PROBLEM WITH THEM
",IT IS THE BEST THING IN THIS UNIVERSITY I LIKE IT
