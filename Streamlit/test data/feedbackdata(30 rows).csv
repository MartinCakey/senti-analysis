Excellent lectures are delivered by teachers and all teachers are very punctual.,All courses material provide very good knowledge in depth .,"Exam pattern is up to the mark and the Cgpa depends on the various marks distributions like ca, mte etc which is very nice as compare to other institutions. Paper checking does not depend on length of ques but on the material which is the best part of it.",Lab work is properly covered in the labs by the faculty and evaluations help to learn more practical knowledge in depth. ,Library facilities are excellent in terms of good techniques that are used over there.,Extra curricular activities also help students to divert their mind from their study for some time. University plays an important role in this task.
Good,"Content of course is perfectly in line with the teaching philosophy that is being perpetuated here i.e cramming,rote learning.",Again the university tests students of their ability to memorize stuff. Questions should emphasize more on concepts rather than testing brain's cramming storage house.,Good,"Its the best thing i have seen in this university,albeit the behaviour of library staff is unprofessional at times. They are whimsically rude.",Complete wastage of time. Again this opinion is strictly personal and may not coincide with others.
teachers give us all the information required to improve the performance.,content of courses improves my knowledge,examination pattern is good,practical work provides detail knowledge of theoretical work,library has huge collection of books from different authors,extracurricular activities increases mental and physical abilities

It's good when compare with my Btech lectures and teaching activities.,Knowledge  and depth of the course  is good but while coming to the material it's not upto the mark.,"This university is far better than other university when coming to the exam pattern,marks disturbation and while coming to paper checking no biased corrections equal to all. ",Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done in Btech.,Good,While coming to extracurriculum activities it's better than any other university which I had come around.

"University teaching here is very much dependent upon slides,though it is a easy way of teaching but still leaving some concepts unclear..otherwise interaction with the faculty is good.Lecture delivery sometimes is not upto the mark and punctuality is  fine. ",Content of the courses is good but some courses need improvement. Course material is not upto the mark. ,Pattern and procedure of the examination is very good. Paper checking needed to be improved.,Sometimes systems at labs are screwed up .Otherwise everything is  at their respected desk.,Library facilities are very good. No issues ,This university is no1 in terms of extracurricular activities and in encouraging students to participate at their comfort levels.

"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student.","The materials or links provided for study purpose is good, clarity in depth of courses but again it differs from teacher to teacher.","Exam pattern and how it is conducted is really seems to be good but it's my first year and when I went to scrutiny for the first time it was not as per my expectations. Teachers have marked the answers as per their choice, they must look for the content rather than the length of answers. So poor paper checking is there.","The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say.",Again some of the faculties don't know how to behave otherwise it is good.,This is really a good thing that events happen in our university regularly but they must be announced early so that every student can prepare themselves for participation because sometimes we get to know about most of the events when they have already been conducted. So announcement must be there.
"University is very good at delivering proper lectures,also the interaction with students is descent. Sometimes the teachers lack in terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input. ",The course notes are very knowledgeable and proper.,Descent.,Good.,Descent.,Good.

Punctuality is good. Most of the teachers are not interacting with students .,Teachers are not giving depth of course . They trying to cover there work only .,It is statisfactory.,3 hours practical is so long. It should be of 2 hours only ,"Well... all the books are not avilable . If they are in library , books are in less number and strength of student are large.",They are really very intersting. All the students enjoys alot and get a chance to showcase there talent
