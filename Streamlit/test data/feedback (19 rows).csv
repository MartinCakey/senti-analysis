It's good,It's appreciable,"Not that much good 
Students are working so hard
But they aren't getting satisfactory result","It's good 
Also depends on teacher's knowledge and student's interest","Sometimes only book is available for some subjects
And it is reserved","It's appreciable
Students who are having interest in co curricular activities, getting a good platform"
"Discipline, punctuality , lecture delivery all are good but hv to do some work for quality of lecture",Satisfied,All are good except paper checking. It should be improved,All good,Its very helpful,All good
"Interaction is very good,accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor,the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems",The books that are recommended do not contain appropriate content; leads the students to depend on slides given by teachers. Hence the knowledge remains superficial,Overall all these things are the plus point of the university,Average ,"Awesome, peaceful, relaxing atmosphere",Good but lacks audience.....as only participants can see these activities on duty leave basis
Perfect,Awesome,Notbad,Too much lanlb file work,All books are not available,Perfect
It is really gud,It is proper,It is very gud,Evaluation method is gud.But the content is more to write in file,I think number of books are very less according to the students .Only 2-3 copies are available.,All the activities are gud and appropriate for students
Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours,Courses are very good and useful ,Examination pattern is good but marks distribution very confusing,excellent,good,very good
in terms of lecture delivery that is good.in terms of punctuality that is also good but in terms of intraction that is very bad. There are some teachers they donot interact and do not litsn our problms that means they do not coprate.,Its good,"Exam pattren is good, marks distribution is also good bt paper cheacking is very tight.",Its good,Thats good,"Thats good but the problm is whenever in university the functions like one india, one world are held we are not alowed to go because we have to attend the classes and if we miss the classes we will gona loose the attendence and everyone knows in lpu attendnce is very important. 
Thanx"
According to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction.More than enough is served. ,Everything is fine. Every thing is taught in depth.Even a single point is elaborated enough to understand. ,Everything is fine. ,I think electrotherapy practical should be of 2 hours.That's enough I think.Rest is fine.,I think stock is not enough more books are required. ,Chance to go and enjoy should be given.I think it should be off when any activity like One India is there to go and enjoy.Otherwise everything is good. 
Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours,Courses are very good and useful ,Examination pattern is good but marks distribution very confusing,excellent,good,very good
not effective and satisfactory in terms of lecture delivery by all the faculty .,content is good enough,satisfactory ,lab duration of 3 hours is very long . ,very cooperative ,extracurricular activies should be held when there are no classes for the students to attend so that every student can enjoy and participate in the events
